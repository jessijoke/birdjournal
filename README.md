# birdjournal

🐦Birdjournal📒 is an application for documenting bird photos by sightings and locations. 

This is a monorepo. 

birdjournal-api contains the backend which is rails & postgresql.
Coming soon: frontend via NextJS.

Plans to integrate Material UI, the eBird API, and still deciding between OpenLayers or Leaflet for mapping locations.
